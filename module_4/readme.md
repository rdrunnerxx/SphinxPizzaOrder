In this assignment we write scalable unit tests using pytest and make applicationâ€™s documentation more easily available (and stylized) using sphinx.  We will construct extensible pizza ordering application: a service that allows other developers to quickly build upon our restaurant template and extend to new menu items and processes.

----------------------------------

In order.py we create an order object that initalizes list of pizzas = [].  This is a list
since order can be for several pizzas.  The list is initially set to none and total
aggregate order cost is 0.00.

Input the customers order for a given pizza goes into input_pizza() method.
In it we initialize the pizza object and attach to the order list of pizzas[].  We also
update the cost.

Pizza object simply sets cost to 0.00 and creates the pizza using the given parameters.

---------------------
# Approach explaining how to create Sphinx documentation and how to connect to RTD: 

After creating the Order pizza project, document using following approach:

-We create a folder called docs in the root folder

-We must run sphinx-quickstart in root folder of the project :

C:\Module 4 - Pytest and Sphinx\docs>sphinx-quickstart

The above command asks name of the project and a few other question. Answer N to separate builds and source.  This will create several folders and files:

_builds
_static
_templates
config.py
index.rst
make.bat
Makefile

We go into config.py and add followings:

import os, sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(".."))

Also add to config.py:

extensions = ["sphinx.ext.autodoc", "sphinx_rtd_theme"]

Then go to root level and run :

C:\Module 4 - Pytest and Sphinx>sphinx-apidoc -o docs src/

Above should create some more files in the docs folder.

Connect to github and push the files to SphinxPizzaOrder repository.  Then go to RTD
and build the document project.
